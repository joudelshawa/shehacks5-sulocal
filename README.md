Designed by Joud El-Shawa and Yusra Salam. App that provides the locations of various small businesses, such as family-owned restaurants and local flower shops. Allows people to support local businesses, especially during these trying times when many are forced to close.

In particular, this app allows the user to choose which category they would like to get pertaining to local and small businesses in London, Ontario, Canada. The categories include Food & Drinks, Retail, Virtual Experience, and Miscellaneous. Once a category is chosen, a new page opens up with a map (implemented using Google Maps API), which contains markers of several businesses in London, Ontario related to said category.

We felt it was important to develop an app that aids struggling local businesses since many are being forced to shut down due to the lack of exposure among other things. The more people use this app, the more small businesses we can save. Support local [businesses]. Or, you know, Sulocal.

List of local businesses was acquired from London Toursim (https://www.londontourism.ca/supporting-local-business).


*Ignore any zip files, as you can see from my account, I was very confused as to how I was supposed to upload all of the files. we're good now! Enjoy!
